After a [Code Retreat](http://coderetreat.org), I've tried to apply come of the [constraints](http://coderetreat.org/facilitating/activity-catalog) to implement [Conway's Game of Life](http://coderetreat.org/gol) in Ruby, with [minitest](https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest).

Feel free to send pull requests if you have alternatives.
